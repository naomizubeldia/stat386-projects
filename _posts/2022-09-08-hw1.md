# Blog Beginnings

I honestly thought that blogs were "dead". I remember the craze that hit society -- especially middle aged women--
back in the 2012 era. Despite this idea of how *archaic* blogs are lol, I am taking a new class at BYU for data science
processes and have learned otherwise. Blogs are actually a nice platform for people to post their own work or ideas. If
you are lucky, you may even be noticed because of a post. I am excited to see how this goes!
