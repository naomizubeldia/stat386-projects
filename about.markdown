# About Naomi
# I have lived all over the country in the south and midwest mostly. I am most recently in Utah going to college at BYU. I love being by the mountains to hike and enjoy nature. I have also taken up a love for country swing dancing too. It has been fun to start a new chapter of my life here. I am now in my last year at BYU about to graduate with a degree in Applied Statistics. I never pictured going into statistics when I was younger, but I really do enjoy it. I hope this blog can help others with concepts that they struggle with because I have really appreciated when I have gotten help myself!
